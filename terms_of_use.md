#### Miscellaneous

Watsi shall not be liable for any failure to perform its

beyond Watsi's reasonable control, including, without limitation,
mechanical, electronic, or communications failure or degradation.
The Terms of Use are personal to you, and are not assignable,
transferable, or sublicensable by you except with Watsi's prior
written consent.  Watsi may assign, transfer, or delegate any of
its rights and obligations hereunder without consent. No agency,
partnership, joint venture, or employment relationship is created
as a result of the Terms of Use and neither party has any
authority of any kind to bind the other in any respect. Where
Watsi requires that you provide an e-mail address, you are
responsible for providing Watsi with your most current e-mail
address. In the event that the last e-mail address you provided
to Watsi is not valid, or for any reason is not capable of
delivering to you any notices required or permitted by the Terms
of Use, Watsi's dispatch of the e-mail containing such notice
will nonetheless constitute effective notice.  You may give
notice to Watsi at the following address: #{Watsi.postal_address}.
Such notice shall be deemed
given when received by Watsi by letter delivered by nationally
recognized overnight delivery service or first class postage
prepaid mail at the above address.
