We use Stripe for payment, analytics, and other business services.
When you make a purchase, Stripe receives information about you, your
transaction, and your payment instrument. Additionally, Stripe
collects standard information about your device that may be sufficient
to uniquely recognize it. Stripe uses this information to operate and
improve the services it provides to us, including for fraud detection
and compliance purposes. You can learn more about Stripe and read its
privacy policy at #{link_to 'https://stripe.com'}.

#### Technology

We use various technologies to enhance your experience on our Site.
Cookies are small pieces of information that a website sends to your computer's
hard drive while you are viewing the website. We may use both session Cookies
(which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent Cookies (which
stay on your computer until you delete them) to provide you with a more
personal and interactive experience on our Site. This type of information is
collected to make the Site more useful to you and to tailor the experience with
us to meet your special interests and needs. Most Web browsers are set to
accept cookies by default. If you prefer, you can usually choose to set your
browser to remove cookies and to reject cookies. If you choose to remove
cookies or reject cookies, this could affect certain features or services of our Site.
Pixel Tags are tiny graphic images with a unique identifier, similar in function to
Cookies, that are used to track online movements of Web users. In contrast to
Cookies, which are stored on a user's computer hard drive, Pixel Tags are
embedded invisibly in Web pages. Pixel Tags also allow us to send e-mail
messages in a format users can read, and they tell us whether e-mails have been
opened to ensure that we are sending only messages that are of interest to our
users. We may use this information to reduce or eliminate messages sent to a
user. We do not tie the information gathered by Pixel Tags to our users' personal
information.

We use Google Analytics to help analyze how users use the Site. Google
Analytics uses Cookies to collect information such as how often users visit the Site,
what pages they visit, and what other sites they used prior to coming to the Site.
We use the information we get from Google Analytics only to improve our Site
and Services. Google Analytics collects only the IP address assigned to you on
the date you visit the Site, rather than your name or other personally identifying
information. We do not combine the information generated through the use of
Google Analytics with your personal information. Although Google Analytics
plants a persistent Cookie on your web browser to identify you as a unique user
the next time you visit the Site, the Cookie cannot be used by anyone but
Google. Google's ability to use and share information collected by Google
Analytics about your visits to the Site is restricted by the Google Analytics Terms of
Use and the Google Privacy Policy.

#### Voluntary Disclosure

Any personal information or content that you voluntarily disclose in public areas
of the Site, such as in the creation of your Profile, becomes publicly available
and can be collected and used by others. You should exercise caution before
disclosing your personal information through these public venues.

#### Security of Your Personal information

We are committed to protecting the security of your Personal information. We
use a variety of industry-standard security technologies and procedures to help
protect your personal information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure.
We also require you to enter a password to access your Account information.
Please do not disclose your Account password to unauthorized people. No
method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is
100% secure, however. Therefore, while Company uses reasonable efforts to
protect your personal information, Company cannot guarantee its absolute
security.

#### Changes to This Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time for any reason. We will
notify you of any changes to our Privacy Policy by posting the new Privacy Policy
at #{link_to privacy_url} and we will change the "Last Updated" date
above. You should consult this Privacy Policy regularly for any changes.
